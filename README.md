# Elastic Full-Waveform-Inversion : Physics-Guided Data-Driven Methods

## Description
paper [[1]](#1).
## Getting Started
### Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Tensorflow-gpu 2.x
* Scipy 
* Numpy
* At least 12 Gig GPU Ram

Please see the requirements documentation for system requirements and more
information about the supported operating systems.
### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Vahid-Negahdari/Inverse_Elastic_Scattering.git
```

2. Change directory into the cloned repository:
``` 
cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
```

3. Run the program using:
``` 
python3 <script_name>.py
```
### Executing program

1. For run the first method:
``` 
python3 First-Method.py
```


2. For run second method  first:
``` 
python3 Displacement.py
```

        * for run Least Square technique
      

```
python3 First-Method.py
python3 First-Method.py
python3 Unet.py
```
3. Third Method
```
python3 First-Method.py
python3 First-Method.py
python3 First-Method.py
```
