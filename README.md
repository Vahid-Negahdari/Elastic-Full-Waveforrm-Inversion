# Elastic Full-Waveform-Inversion : Physics-Guided Data-Driven Methods

##:art: About the project
paper [[1]](#1).
## :key: Getting Started
In order to use this code, following this instruction:
### Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Tensorflow-gpu 2.x
* Scipy 
* Numpy
* At least 12 Gig GPU Ram

Please see the requirements documentation for system requirements and more
information about the supported operating systems.
### Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Vahid-Negahdari/Inverse_Elastic_Scattering.git
```

2. Change directory into the cloned repository:
``` 
cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
```
### Executing program

1.For run the first method, **Direct Deep Learning Inversion** :
``` 
cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
```
2.For use techniques within second method, first
``` 
cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
```    
* For use **Least Square** technique
  ``` 
  cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
  ```
* For use **Linear-to-Nonlinear** technique
  ``` 
  cd All-In-One-Python-Projects/<Project_name>
  ```  
* For use **Inverse Convolution** technique
  ``` 
  this code soon completed
  ```  
3. For use third method, **New-VAE** technique, initially need run linear-to-nonlinear technique and then run :
```
python3 First-Method.py
```
